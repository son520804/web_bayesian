Observations and Beliefs\n\nThe world is a chaotic place, from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to chains of extreme weather events, to the explore and exploit dilemma, our live is fraught with uncertainty and randomness. Some people seem to enjoy taking risks and feel motivated in the unpredictability in lives, while others may find the randomness of life deeply distressing. While we sometimes may not wish to acknowledge it, uncertainty is a natural and unavoidable part of life, since very little about our lives is constant or totally certain. As the coronavirus outbreak has indicated, life can change very quickly and very unpredictably, and we as humans can't control over everything that happens to us and our surroundings.\n\nIn this lecture we will introduce you the problems that we're trying to solve, and in the rest of the lecture, I'll outline in Bayesian perspective, how do we model the uncertainties of the world, how to model real-world scenarios and beliefs using a concise structure, and finally, how to consider and quantify randomness during data analysis using Bayesian Statistics?",

      "source": "Suppose you are trying to figure out how many points would Michigan Wolverine team score in the next NCAA basketball game. The number of points must be between 0 to infinity. Without giving any further information such as the opponent team and the previous team performance, there is an apparent lack of pattern or predictability in the coming game. This is by definition, randomness. So to do that, would you assign equal probabilities to the numbers 0 through let's say 1000? Probably not. Maybe you have followed the NBA history and know that 186 points is the highest score in a game in the NBA history, and it was scored by Detroit Pistons over the Denver Nuggets in 1983. Maybe you know well about the players in the Wolverine team. You probably won't be able to assign the exact probabilities, but you can do better than assigning equal probabilities to up to 1000 integers.\n\nSuppose you are a newly hired consultant in Environmental Protection Agency for a proposition to raise fundings to conserve the forest in California. You want to estimate the environmental cost for forest, and the number could be any positive number. Without having further information regarding loss of economy due to wildfire and deforestation, as well as previous wildfire reports, there is again a lack of predictability regarding how much the funding should be petitioned. This tells you the randomness of the problem, and apparently such randomness would bring out uncertainty of how much fundings should be raised. As a consultant, would you assign equal probabilities to the numbers 0 through let's say 2 billions? Again, you probably won't do that. Maybe you will talk to some experts and do some field research regarding the ecology and biodiversity of California, planning for some interviews with the rangers in Yoshmite and Redwood National Parks, etc, in order to collect textual and verbal information relevant to making a plausible estimate. So instead of just guessing by random, you might make use of some information to represent your initial belief.\n\nOkay! So hopefully these examples help you better identify the linkages between uncertainty, randomness, observations and beliefs, as well as help you ideate and prototype real-life problems that associated with dealing with random elements and uncertainty by incorporating our own belief and the observations.",

      "source": "Now let's see how Bayesian statisticians would typically deal with these problems. Central to the application of Bayesian methods is the idea of a distribution. In general, a distribution\ndescribes how likely a certain outcome will occur given a series of inputs. For instance, we might have a\ndistribution which describes how many points a given NBA team will score in a game (the\noutcome).\n\nIn Bayesian statistics, we consider our initial understanding of the outcome of an event before data is\ncollected. We do this by creating a **prior distribution**. Similar to most data science methods, we will\nthen collect the observed data to create a model using some probability distribution. We rely on that model\ncalled **likelihood** to update our initial understanding (**prior distribution**) using the **Bayes'\nTheorem**.\n\nWe won't go into the maths of Bayes' theorem, but the theorem suggests that by using the observed data as\nnew evidence, the updated belief incorporates our initial understanding and the evidence related to the\nproblem being examined, just like we cumulate knowledge by learning the problems or doing experiments.\n**Bayes's theorem** also suggests a nice property that the updated belief is proportional to the product of\nthe **prior distribution** and the **likelihood**. We call the updated belief **posterior distribution**. \n\n![](assets/Bayesian_Model.png)\n\nBayesian method is carried out in four steps.\n\nThe first step of using Bayesian method to solve a problem with uncertainty is to form some prior distributions before observing data. This **prior distribution** can come from personal experience, literature, event history, or expert opinion. Next, we need the data. You may **collect data** from various online sources, surveys, interviews and any kind of activities that helps you learn about the problem. In our example, we can collect data by recording NBA games for a few seasons in a database. Then based on the data we collect, we can use visualization techniques to understand how to use a suitable probabilistic model called **likelihood** that represents the distribution of the observed data. The procedures of Bayesian inference meld the information in the prior distribution with the data from a survey or experiment to obtain a **posterior distribution** that is then used to make a point or interval estimate. The algorithms that take the prior distribution and the likelihood to generate the posterior distribution by Bayes' rules is the coolest part of Bayesian analysis, and in fact, it's a open area for research. Traditional methods include integrating the random variables by hand and determining the posterior distribution in closed form. However, in many cases, the posterior distribution can not be determined just by integration (in calculus term, the posterior distribution is not **analytic**), so computational tools are needed to achieve this goal. In later this course and the second course (**Bayesian Estimation**) of the specialization, we will learn **probabilistic programming languages**, which is a renowned programming tool to compute posterior distributions automatically even when the models are complex in construct. Specifically, we will explore the fantastic Python packages PyMC3 and Arviz to conduct full Bayesian analysis and visualization by algorithm-assisted simulation.\n\nAt the end, the posterior distributions derived through computational methods are just the updated belief by incorporating both the prior belief and the data. At this point, you can compare the goodness of models and priors. It is a common practice to visualize the results from several prior distributions or different models by looking at the trajectory of each posterior distribution.\n\nSo hopefully we have gained a sense about modeling uncertainty, randomness, observations and beliefs and the methodology of a practitioner of Bayesian statistics would work on uncertainty and randomness in real-world problems. At the end of the lecture, I invite you to contribute your thoughts and ideas. I would like to hear your examples and opinions about why do you think it is important to model uncertainty, and how does modeling uncertainty and quantifying randomness can help you day to day work? Please use the discussion forum and tools to write your ideas on! Bye for now!\n",
